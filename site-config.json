    "bio": "mari park is a Midwest-based singer-songwriter, producer, DJ and guitarist who began their musical journey at age 11 learning classical guitar in their hometown of Saint Louis, Missouri. At 18 mari would begin writing and creating their own music before graduating high school. Their sophomore year of college they would release their first EP 'sharp objects' in 2022 and 'then you don't cry' the following summer while studying classical guitar performance and TIMARA at Oberlin Conservatory of Music. mari's discography explores themes of youth, love, trauma and mental illness through a lens of reflective nostalgia. Their instrumentals range from simple acoustic guitar to distorted field recordings to pop-inspired synths and electronic drums. mari's lyrics remain haunting, unapologetic, and sometimes graphic but always honest.",
